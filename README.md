# ACMUtility
Java application to create Jekyll posts for the website.  

It allows you to edit current posts as well as create new posts.  You can also create a new post from an existing post.  

The only thing it does not support yet is the ability to push to a remote.  This will be done eventually but as of right now you must do it manually.
